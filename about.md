Hi. People call me Sayed. I did my pilot studies in Oxford, UK and my initial flights in Phoenix, Arizona. Currently, I am a full time airline first officer in one of the major airlines in the Middle East. I chose to become a pilot because I was so obsessed with flying. I told my father, I need to calm down this desire before doing anything else.

I sat up this website to satisfy another passion of mine: Teaching. I like passing on what I know to others and I find great pleasure in doing so.

Do not hesistate to contact me through my [Linked In](http://linkedin.com/in/sydalwedaie/) profile.

*Thank You for reading!*
